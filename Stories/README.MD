# Here are ontology stories in the experiments
In our experiment, we have two sets of experiments, the Initial experiment and the Main experiment. Stories are as follows:

## Short Narratives (Initial Experiment)
### Story 1: 
This story discusses two primary food categories: vegetarian foods and meat. Vegetarian animals exclusively eat vegetables, while non-vegetarian animals can consume vegetables or meat without restrictions on their diets. In the context of animals, rabbits are given as an example of vegetarian eaters. The relation "eats" describes the relationship between animals and the types of food they consume.
here are the competency questions:
```
[ 'There are two types of food: vegetarian foods and non-vegetarian foods.',
  'vegetarian animals do not eat meat but only vegetables.',
  'Non-vegetarian animals eat vegetables or meat without any restrictions.',
  'Rabbits eat only vegetarian foods.',
  'Relation eats is a relation between animals and foods.',
  'create an individual rabbit R1 that eats individual meat m1']
```
