        "Your task is to contribute in creation of a well-structured ontology informations that appeared in the given story, requirements, and restrictions (if there are any). You should only provide steps to solve this task not actually solving it. Imagin yourself as a prompter of chatGPT and we want to use chain of thoughts. So in this step only create a plan or steps to solve the task. the way you approach this is that you create only a code block in the output that contains a list of strings. Each string in the list is a plan or thought. the first string is the first thought and so on. do not output any other comment or explanation. here are some definisions of ontology components to help you understand the problem in a better way:\n",
        "Classes are the keywords/classes that are going to be node types in the knowledge graph ontology. try to extract all classes, in addition, classes are also can be defined for reification. We use Turtle Syntax for representation. Hierarchies are rdfs:subClassOf in the turtle syntax. They can be used to classify similar classes in one superclass. To do this you can find similar nodes and create/use a class as their parent class, for example, adding the node \"Cl_employee\" is a good middleware and superclass for \"Cl_Professors\" and \"Cl_Administrator\" if the story is about modeling ontology of a university. Mostly the lengthier the hierarchy the better. One way can be categorizing classes into several classes and creating superclasses for them. Important: Class names have Cl_ as the prefix for example Cl_Professors. Also keep in mind you can add Equivalent To, General class axioms, Disjoint with, and Disjoint Union of, for each class.\n",
        "In your ontology modeling, for each competency question, when faced with complex scenarios that involve more than two entities or a combination of entities and datatypes, apply reification. Specifically, create a pivot class to act as an intermediary for these entities, ensuring the nuanced relationships are accurately captured. For instance, when representing \"a user accessed a resource at a given time\", establish a pivot class like Cl_UserResourceUsage, linked from the user, resource, and the specific time of access to Cl_UserResourceInteraction, rather than directly connecting the user to both the resource and time.\n",
        "Then you need to create properties (owl:Property). In this step, you use classes from the previous stage and create object and data properties to connect them and establish the ontology. Always output a turtle syntax, if you need more classes to model a competency question between more than 2 concepts, feel free to add more pivot (reification) classes here. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions, restrictions, and stories. At this stage, you can create both data and object properties. Data properties are between classes or hierarchy classes and data types such as xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:boolean, xsd:byte, xsd:double, xsd:float and etc. For example, in the university domain, we have: employee_id a owl:Property ; rdfs:domain :cl_teacher ; rdfs:range xsd:integer. Object properties are between classes. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions and the story. Feel free to use rdfs:subPropertyOf for creating hierarchies for relations. For modeling properties (object or data properties) if it is necessary, use these relations characteristics: Functional, Inverse functional, Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Reflexive, and Irreflexive. Also, you are flexible in domain and range so you can use Cl_class1 or Cl_class2 in domain and range or disjoint with, the inverse of between relations.\n",
        "Your output at this stage is a plan. like step 1, step 2, ... step n (max 10 steps). dont create the ontology at this stage. after this stage i will give you 'next' in the chat and you create a code plus a small plan for the next step. when the last step executed, the final output be the final owl ontology that models the story with its restirictions and be able to answer the competency questions. Plan steps must be in a python list of string like: ['step1','step2',...]\n",

        "treeOfT='''Your task is to contribute in creation of a well-structured ontology informations that appeared in the given story, requirements, and restrictions (if there are any). You should only provide few diffierent plans that each contains steps to solve this task not actually solving it. Imagin yourself as a prompter of chatGPT and we want to use tree of thoughts. So in this step only create few plans with steps to solve the task. the way you approach this is that you create only a code block in the output that contains a list of  list of strings. Each list is a different plan to solve the problem from step 1 to end, and each string in every list is a thought. the first string is the first thought/step and so on. do not output any other comment or explanation. here are some definisions of ontology components to help you understand the problem in a better way:\n",
        "CClasses are the keywords/classes that are going to be node types in the knowledge graph ontology. try to extract all classes, in addition, classes are also can be defined for reification. We use Turtle Syntax for representation. Hierarchies are rdfs:subClassOf in the turtle syntax. They can be used to classify similar classes in one superclass. To do this you can find similar nodes and create/use a class as their parent class, for example, adding the node \"Cl_employee\" is a good middleware and superclass for \"Cl_Professors\" and \"Cl_Administrator\" if the story is about modeling ontology of a university. Mostly the lengthier the hierarchy the better. One way can be categorizing classes into several classes and creating superclasses for them. Important: Class names have Cl_ as the prefix for example Cl_Professors. Also keep in mind you can add Equivalent To, General class axioms, Disjoint with, and Disjoint Union of, for each class.\n",
        "In your ontology modeling, for each competency question, when faced with complex scenarios that involve more than two entities or a combination of entities and datatypes, apply reification. Specifically, create a pivot class to act as an intermediary for these entities, ensuring the nuanced relationships are accurately captured. For instance, when representing \"a user accessed a resource at a given time\", establish a pivot class like Cl_UserResourceUsage, linked from the user, resource, and the specific time of access to Cl_UserResourceInteraction, rather than directly connecting the user to both the resource and time.\n",
        "Then you need to create properties (owl:Property). In this step, you use classes from the previous stage and create object and data properties to connect them and establish the ontology. Always output a turtle syntax, if you need more classes to model a competency question between more than 2 concepts, feel free to add more pivot (reification) classes here. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions, restrictions, and stories. At this stage, you can create both data and object properties. Data properties are between classes or hierarchy classes and data types such as xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:boolean, xsd:byte, xsd:double, xsd:float and etc. For example, in the university domain, we have: employee_id a owl:Property ; rdfs:domain :cl_teacher ; rdfs:range xsd:integer. Object properties are between classes. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions and the story. Feel free to use rdfs:subPropertyOf for creating hierarchies for relations. For modeling properties (object or data properties) if it is necessary, use these relations characteristics: Functional, Inverse functional, Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Reflexive, and Irreflexive. Also, you are flexible in domain and range so you can use Cl_class1 or Cl_class2 in domain and range or disjoint with, the inverse of between relations.\n",

        "Your output at this stage is a list of three different plans (make sure they solve the problem with different prespectives). Each plan contain a list like step 1, step 2, ... step n. dont create the ontology at this stage. after this stage i will give you 'plan x, next' in the chat and you perform the next step from plan x only (dont pay attention to the other plans). create a code plus a small plan for the next step. when the last step executed, the final output be the final owl ontology that models the story with its restirictions and be able to answer the competency questions. We will later compare the results of the owl files with 'merge' commands at the end (at this stage you need to see them and create a one owl file based on them, it would be like you see the answers of few different ontologist and based on your opinion pick or craete one from them), so dont compare untill the command.\n",

You should only provide few diffierent plans that each contains steps to solve this task not actually solving it. Imagin yourself as a prompter of chatGPT and we want to use tree of thoughts. So in this step only create few plans with steps to solve the task. the way you approach this is that you create only a code block in the output that contains a list of  list of strings. Each list is a different plan to solve the problem from step 1 to end, and each string in every list is a thought. the first string is the first thought/step and so on. do not output any other comment or explanation. here are some definisions of ontology components to help you understand the problem in a better way:\n",
        "CClasses are the keywords/classes that are going to be node types in the knowledge graph ontology. try to extract all classes, in addition, classes are also can be defined for reification. We use Turtle Syntax for representation. Hierarchies are rdfs:subClassOf in the turtle syntax. They can be used to classify similar classes in one superclass. To do this you can find similar nodes and create/use a class as their parent class, for example, adding the node \"Cl_employee\" is a good middleware and superclass for \"Cl_Professors\" and \"Cl_Administrator\" if the story is about modeling ontology of a university. Mostly the lengthier the hierarchy the better. One way can be categorizing classes into several classes and creating superclasses for them. Important: Class names have Cl_ as the prefix for example Cl_Professors. Also keep in mind you can add Equivalent To, General class axioms, Disjoint with, and Disjoint Union of, for each class.\n",
        "In your ontology modeling, for each competency question, when faced with complex scenarios that involve more than two entities or a combination of entities and datatypes, apply reification. Specifically, create a pivot class to act as an intermediary for these entities, ensuring the nuanced relationships are accurately captured. For instance, when representing \"a user accessed a resource at a given time\", establish a pivot class like Cl_UserResourceUsage, linked from the user, resource, and the specific time of access to Cl_UserResourceInteraction, rather than directly connecting the user to both the resource and time.\n",
        "Then you need to create properties (owl:Property). In this step, you use classes from the previous stage and create object and data properties to connect them and establish the ontology. Always output a turtle syntax, if you need more classes to model a competency question between more than 2 concepts, feel free to add more pivot (reification) classes here. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions, restrictions, and stories. At this stage, you can create both data and object properties. Data properties are between classes or hierarchy classes and data types such as xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:boolean, xsd:byte, xsd:double, xsd:float and etc. For example, in the university domain, we have: employee_id a owl:Property ; rdfs:domain :cl_teacher ; rdfs:range xsd:integer. Object properties are between classes. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions and the story. Feel free to use rdfs:subPropertyOf for creating hierarchies for relations. For modeling properties (object or data properties) if it is necessary, use these relations characteristics: Functional, Inverse functional, Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Reflexive, and Irreflexive. Also, you are flexible in domain and range so you can use Cl_class1 or Cl_class2 in domain and range or disjoint with, the inverse of between relations.\n",

We will later compare the results of the owl files with 'merge' commands at the end (at this stage you need to see them and create a one owl file based on them, it would be like you see the answers of few different ontologist and based on your opinion pick or craete one from them), so dont compare untill the command.\n",

              "'Your task is to contribute in creation of a well-structured ontology informations that appeared in the given story, requirements, and restrictions (if there are any). You should only provide few diffierent plans that each contains steps to solve this task not actually solving it. Imagin yourself as a prompter of chatGPT and we want to use tree of thoughts. So in this step only create few plans with steps to solve the task. the way you approach this is that you create only a code block in the output that contains a list of  list of strings. Each list is a different plan to solve the problem from step 1 to end, and each string in every list is a thought. the first string is the first thought/step and so on. do not output any other comment or explanation. here are some definisions of ontology components to help you understand the problem in a better way:\\nCClasses are the keywords/classes that are going to be node types in the knowledge graph ontology. try to extract all classes, in addition, classes are also can be defined for reification. We use Turtle Syntax for representation. Hierarchies are rdfs:subClassOf in the turtle syntax. They can be used to classify similar classes in one superclass. To do this you can find similar nodes and create/use a class as their parent class, for example, adding the node \"Cl_employee\" is a good middleware and superclass for \"Cl_Professors\" and \"Cl_Administrator\" if the story is about modeling ontology of a university. Mostly the lengthier the hierarchy the better. One way can be categorizing classes into several classes and creating superclasses for them. Important: Class names have Cl_ as the prefix for example Cl_Professors. Also keep in mind you can add Equivalent To, General class axioms, Disjoint with, and Disjoint Union of, for each class.\\nIn your ontology modeling, for each competency question, when faced with complex scenarios that involve more than two entities or a combination of entities and datatypes, apply reification. Specifically, create a pivot class to act as an intermediary for these entities, ensuring the nuanced relationships are accurately captured. For instance, when representing \"a user accessed a resource at a given time\", establish a pivot class like Cl_UserResourceUsage, linked from the user, resource, and the specific time of access to Cl_UserResourceInteraction, rather than directly connecting the user to both the resource and time.\\nThen you need to create properties (owl:Property). In this step, you use classes from the previous stage and create object and data properties to connect them and establish the ontology. Always output a turtle syntax, if you need more classes to model a competency question between more than 2 concepts, feel free to add more pivot (reification) classes here. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions, restrictions, and stories. At this stage, you can create both data and object properties. Data properties are between classes or hierarchy classes and data types such as xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:boolean, xsd:byte, xsd:double, xsd:float and etc. For example, in the university domain, we have: employee_id a owl:Property ; rdfs:domain :cl_teacher ; rdfs:range xsd:integer. Object properties are between classes. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions and the story. Feel free to use rdfs:subPropertyOf for creating hierarchies for relations. For modeling properties (object or data properties) if it is necessary, use these relations characteristics: Functional, Inverse functional, Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Reflexive, and Irreflexive. Also, you are flexible in domain and range so you can use Cl_class1 or Cl_class2 in domain and range or disjoint with, the inverse of between relations.\\n\\nYour output at this stage is a list of three different plans (a 2D list) (make sure they solve the problem with different prespectives). Each plan contain a list like [step 1:, step 2:, ... step n:]. dont create the ontology at this stage. after this stage i will give you \\'plan x, next\\' in the chat and you perform the next step from plan x only (dont pay attention to the other plans). create a code plus a small plan for the next step. when the last step executed, the final output be the final owl ontology that models the story with its restirictions and be able to answer the competency questions. We will later compare the results of the owl files with \\'merge\\' commands at the end (at this stage you need to see them and create a one owl file based on them, it would be like you see the answers of few different ontologist and based on your opinion pick or craete one from them), so dont compare untill the command.\\nthese are the prifixes:\\n@prefix : <http://www.example.org/test#> .\\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\\nImportant: your output should be only owl turtle. Don\\'t write any explanation before the code block or after. Also the code must have 0 comments.\\nend of footer\\nCommon mistake:\\n1- plans are identical, try to think differently when generating plans. For producing different plans, you can take three of these approaches and create plans based on them:Bottom-Up Plan, Top-Down Plan,,Agile Plan, Waterfall Plan, Incremental Plan, Spiral Plan, Prototype Plan, Evolutionary Plan, RAD (Rapid Application Development) Plan, Scrum Plan\\n2- important: when i ask to execute plan x, step y, your output at executing steps must be only codes not explanations.\\n3- producing output not based on the story and its competency questions\\nhere is one story to know what they look like (The final ontology is about this story and its competency questions):\\nTheatre productions\\nDuring each year a number of theatre festivals are held in cities around Italy. In January 2007 a festival called “Roma Loves Shakespeare” took place in Rome. Two different productions of “The Merchant of Venice” participated, one from a theatre in Pisa and the other from a theatre institute in Venice, featuring an ensemble of university art students. Other plays were Othello and a Midsummer Night’s Dream.\\nThe Grand Theatre in Rome offers two theatre shows each evening during September and October 2009. The play set up in this period is the \"Merchant of Venice\",given through an ensemble of well-known Italian actors. The Merchant of Venice was written during 1596 to 1598 by William Shakespeare, and it has 5 distinct acts. The premier of this production at The Grand Theatre was on September 7. Il Gazzettino gave the setup of the play 5 stars in a recent review.\\nFabio Bianchi is an Italian actor employed at the theatre since May 2004, he is a part of the ensemble setting up the Merchant of Venice and he plays the Duke of Venice but also a servant in one of the scenes. During the second and third week of September the role of Shylock is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as a special guest actor.\\nWhen did a certain theatre festival take place?\\nWhere did a certain festival take place?\\nWhat plays could be seen during a certain theatre festival?\\nIn what city is a certain theatre located?\\nIn what country is a certain city located?\\nWhat play is the basis of this production?\\nWho are the members of a certain ensemble at a certain point in time? \\nWhat plays did a certain author write?\\nDuring what time period was a certain play written?\\nHow many acts does a particular play contain?\\nWhen was the premier of a certain production?\\nWhat is the “star rating” given by a certain newspaper for a certain production?\\nAt what time did a certain actor start working for a specific theatre?\\nWhat roles does a certain person have within a certain production at a certain point in time?  \\nA production has exactly one premier.\\nEnd of story\\n\\nNow here are the plans you created, in the following, we show output of each plan you created in a list of output[\\n[\"Step 1: Identify main classes from the story such as Theatre, Festival, Production, Play, Actor, Role, City, Country\",\\n \"Step 2: Create subclasses for identified classes if necessary.

        "cqbycq_prompt = '''Your task is to contribute in creation of a well-structured ontology informations that appeared in the given story, requirements, and restrictions (if there are any).\n",
        "The way you approach this is first you pick this competency question number \"{CQ}\" and read the given turtle RDF (we append the code at the end of the prevoius one) to know what is the current ontology till this stage (it can be empty at the begining). Then you add or change the RDF so it can answer to this competency question. Your output at each stage is an append to the previous ones, just do not repeat. You only need to solve the question number so do not touch the next questions since they belong to the next stages of development. you can read this definisions to understand the concepts:\n",
        "lasses are the keywords/classes that are going to be node types in the knowledge graph ontology. try to extract all classes, in addition, classes are also can be defined for reification. We use Turtle Syntax for representation. Hierarchies are rdfs:subClassOf in the turtle syntax. They can be used to classify similar classes in one superclass. To do this you can find similar nodes and create/use a class as their parent class, for example, adding the node \"Cl_employee\" is a good middleware and superclass for \"Cl_Professors\" and \"Cl_Administrator\" if the story is about modeling ontology of a university. Mostly the lengthier the hierarchy the better. One way can be categorizing classes into several classes and creating superclasses for them. Important: Class names have Cl_ as the prefix for example Cl_Professors. Also keep in mind you can add Equivalent To, General class axioms, Disjoint with, and Disjoint Union of, for each class.\n",
        "In your ontology modeling, for each competency question, when faced with complex scenarios that involve more than two entities or a combination of entities and datatypes, apply reification. Specifically, create a pivot class to act as an intermediary for these entities, ensuring the nuanced relationships are accurately captured. For instance, when representing \"a user accessed a resource at a given time\", establish a pivot class like Cl_UserResourceUsage, linked from the user, resource, and the specific time of access to Cl_UserResourceInteraction, rather than directly connecting the user to both the resource and time.\n",
        "Then you need to create properties (owl:Property). In this step, you use classes from the previous stage and create object and data properties to connect them and establish the ontology. Always output a turtle syntax, if you need more classes to model a competency question between more than 2 concepts, feel free to add more pivot (reification) classes here. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions, restrictions, and stories. At this stage, you can create both data and object properties. Data properties are between classes or hierarchy classes and data types such as xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:decimal, xsd:dateTime, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:boolean, xsd:byte, xsd:double, xsd:float and etc. For example, in the university domain, we have: employee_id a owl:Property ; rdfs:domain :cl_teacher ; rdfs:range xsd:integer. Object properties are between classes. try to find as much relation as possible by reading competency questions and the story. Feel free to use rdfs:subPropertyOf for creating hierarchies for relations. For modeling properties (object or data properties) if it is necessary, use these relations characteristics: Functional, Inverse functional, Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Reflexive, and Irreflexive. Also, you are flexible in domain and range so you can use Cl_class1 or Cl_class2 in domain and range or disjoint with, the inverse of between relations.\n",
        "It is common to forget to add relations that are related to reification: In RDF reification, achieving precise modeling is pivotal, especially when handling multifaceted scenarios where mere binary associations fall short. Take for instance the statement, \"a user used a resource at a time\". While it might initially seem to involve a direct link between a 'user' and a 'resource', it inherently embodies three entities: a 'user', a 'resource', and a 'time'. Directly connecting 'user' to both 'resource' and 'time' fails to capture the essence of the statement, as it obscures which resource was utilized by the user at a specific time. To address this, a more sophisticated modeling approach is needed, invoking a pivot class, Cl_usingResource. This pivot class acts as an intermediary, linking both Cl_user and Cl_resource. Furthermore, it integrates a time property to denote the exact instance of usage. By employing this method, we can coherently model the statement, ensuring that the user's interaction with a specific resource at a distinct time is unambiguously represented. This approach highlights the imperative of ontology design patterns and the necessity of intermediary nodes when modeling complex relationships involving multiple entities or a mix of entities and datatypes.\n",
        "Upon implementation of restrictions, feel free to use owl:equivalentClass [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;  owl:onProperty :{{relation}} ;  owl:allValuesFrom :{{Class}} ] ; in this way, you can put restrictions for classes such as class Cl_C1 is the only class that uses the relation R. or you can put soft restrictions by using owl:someValuesFrom. Also, you can use general class axioms: [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :R1 ; owl:someValuesFrom :Cl_1 ; rdfs:subClassOf :Cl_2 ] when you want to put restrictions on the definition of a class based on its relation and the definition is necessary but not enough (if it is enough it would be equivalent to owl:equivalentClass).\n",
