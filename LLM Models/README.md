# Large Language Models
LLMs are sophisticated computational systems in natural language processing. Utilizing deep learning, particularly neural network architectures like transformers, LLMs are trained on extensive text datasets, enabling them to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text. These models are adept at various language tasks such as translation, summarization, and content creation.

In our research methodology, it was crucial to ensure a comprehensive examination of various LLMs to achieve generalizable results and avoid model-specific biases. We, therefore, use a representative selection of models spanning both proprietary and open-source versions. We engaged with the following models: 
- **[GPT-3.5](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models)**
- **[GPT-4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models)**
- **[Bard - obsoleted](Bard.google.com)**, replaced by Gemini

And  from the closed-source spectrum. Regarding open-source models, our experiments encompass 
- **[Lama-7B](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)** - [implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/text-generation-webui-colab/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ipynb)
- **[Lama-13B](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)** - [implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/text-generation-webui-colab/blob/main/llama-2-13b-chat.ipynb)
- **[Llama2-70B](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)** - [implementation](https://replicate.com/meta/llama-2-70b-chat)
- **[Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/chavinlo/gpt4-x-alpaca)**- [implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/text-generation-webui-colab/blob/main/gpt4-x-alpaca-13b-native-4bit-128g.ipynb)
- **[Falcon-7B-Instruct](https://falconllm.tii.ae/)** - [implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/text-generation-webui-colab/blob/main/falcon-7b-instruct-GPTQ-4bit.ipynb)
- **[WizardLM](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM)** [implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/text-generation-webui-colab/blob/main/wizard-lm-13b-1.1-GPTQ-4bit-128g.ipynb)
- **[Alpaca-LoRA](https://huggingface.co/chavinlo/gpt4-x-alpaca)** [implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/text-generation-webui-colab/blob/main/gpt4-x-alpaca-13b-native-4bit-128g.ipynb).

By using this broad selection, we aimed to achieve a holistic understanding and validation of our research objectives. However, it is important to note that the purpose of our study is not to compare the effectiveness of these models but merely to determine if any of them can produce sufficiently high-quality OWL suggestions and study the characteristics of such suggestions. Hence, this is why we first performed initial experiments on a broad range of models but then quickly settled for a smaller set in subsequent experiments.

An important component when using LLMs is the memory. Since an LLM can only handle a certain size of the current context, i.e., what it takes into account when addressing a new prompt, therefore an external memory can be used as a module that stores information, such as previously generated code, plans and provides a history of past communications with an LLM for future prompts if the prompting techniques need them. In our experiments, a memory is used for all prompting methods except zero-shop. 


## GPT Models API
For accessing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, we used Microsoft Azure API. The function for communicating with API is like this: 
```python
def chat_with_gpt(prompt_text,temp = 0,penalty = 0):
    # print(prompt_text)
    # print('\n\n\n')
    # input()
    # return open('input.txt').read()
    openai.api_type = "azure"
    openai.api_base = "" # set your base here
    openai.api_version = "2023-07-01-preview"
    openai.api_key = ""  #set your API key here
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
      engine=  "", #put the name of your model, e.g.:GPT-4 32k context, GPT-3.5 turbo , ...
      messages = [{"role":"system","content":prompt_text}],
      temperature=temp,
      top_p=0,
      frequency_penalty=penalty,
      presence_penalty=penalty,
      stop=None)
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```
**Temperature** is a parameter that controls the randomness of the output generated by a model.
**Frequency penalty** - this parameter, by definition, decreases the likelihood of repeating the exact same text in a response or penalizes tokens based on how many times they've already appeared in the text. OpenAI says that this decreases the likelihood of the output repeating itself verbatim.
